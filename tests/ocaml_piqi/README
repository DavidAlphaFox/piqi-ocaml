Compile complex piqi specification "piqi.org/piqi.piqi" to produce OCaml
parsers and generators.

Then build a program which reads and writes back a serialized binary object
which happens to be a serialized "piqi.piqi" specification.

Also testing piqi imports in OCaml by compiling and linking "piqobj.piqi" which
imports "piqtype.piqi"

NOTE: "piqtype.ml" is required for "piqi.ml", since "piqi.piqi" uses "piq-any"
type which implicitly requires "piqtype.ml" when compiled to .ml.
